Welcome

Another exploratory project since I'm growing to love JavaScript more and more as I become more familiar with it.

A few years ago I began what would become my mercussion project, where I can compose drumline music in my own text-based format and very quickly product PDFs, MIDI files, WAV files or MusicXML. Bought Sibelius last year, but I still prefer my own tools. This is the next iteration of my tools, where I see how far I can go. Perhaps I can generate great looking PDFs myself, and even compose directly in the browser ....

Also, I want branch-based revisions while composing, so that's on the to-do list. But I have to get the canvas drawing down first.
