Score object
- has to figure out how much space it needs for title and padding first, before drawing staff
- all along it knows how much width it has to work with

- slots are drawing in the order they're added?
	- title slot spans top
		- split into temp, title, author, subtitle, etc
	
When it gets to StaffGroups
- tells StaffGroup to start drawing at X
- recurses, calculating how much it can fit comfortably in that width
	- goes down to Voices
		- then measures
			- then notes
	- if it starts drawing something that will push past the given width, it backs out, somehow making note of the last measure that was successful
- then it somehow starts drawing again, specifying that it should space things out more, but we can do that later

- needs to know where to start, width we have, and whether to stop after X measures



QUESTIONS

- would it benefit us to flatten the tree when drawing?
- condense all slots, and objects, use predictable names so we have less message passing going on.
