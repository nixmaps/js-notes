QUESTIONS

* can you create a hidden canvas to draw upon, extract a portion and copy to a location on another canvas?
* how will memory consumption be, since i'm going to be creating TONS of objects, with functions declared for each instantiation?
* how to relay Y position to notes from staff down through measure?
	- would rather staff not have to know about note names ... maybe measure could inherit that functionality somehow?
	* should we explicitly have to add measures at all?
		- makes it easier to have a voice be silent for a long duration
		- might help with real-time editing, being able to update just the region of the canvas taken up by a measure

IDEAS

* separate placement and alignment from the rest of the music stuff
* beaming rules, rather than having to explicitly specify beam options

* staffs are 'pushy' in the Y direction, with other staffs
* what about having children tell their parents how much space they need?
- drawing levels/regions above or below the staff. staff gets to push them up or down depending on the notes present on the staff.

TODO

* notes are drawn "on top" (after) a staff, but dependent upon it
* dynamics are drawn after notes, but also relative to staff variables
	* multiple dependencies
	* depending upon position: above/below/left/right

FLOW

- staff.draw()
	- recurse to leaves, which set their necessary dimensions (if applicable)
	- parents add up necessary dimensions?

	- each object has a minimum region width: note has min-width
		- starts as space needed to fit the font element (and the sharp, flag, grace note, etc)
		- note has 2 child arrays, above and below (the staff)
			- note gives the proper starting x/y for alignment with note, and so it doesn't overlap the staff
	- each object sets minimums, then recurses into children, which may expand width or other properties
	- stems and beams are relative to, but not children of, a note
		- the note is in charge of telling this object where to begin drawing


SCENARIOS

empty staff
	- should it have a default width?
pushables
	- they have a scheme ... 'above': would contact all parents, getting their positions, and ensuring it's always above the ancestors
	- means the furthest descendents are above ... order matters


CAN WE FIGURE OUT THE API BY USAGE SCENARIO?

just easier to add notes to each voice separately ... maybe jj

var staff1 = staff('treble', 4, 4); // treble clef in 4/4
staff1.voices('snare-hihat', 'kick'); // note the order
staff1.measure([
	note('c1#', 'b1').voice('snare-hihat'), // simultaneous
]);

INTERNALLY

{
	staffs: [
		{
			clef: 'treble',
			measures: [
				[ // first measure
					[4,4], // time signature change/specification
					{
						base: 16, // 16th note
						// note names correspond to 'alignment hints' given by the staff
						name: 'c1', // might be an array, right?
						rest: false,
						tie: true // ties to first "tie:false" note
					},
					{ // note inherits values before it for ease?
						name: 'd1'
						tie: false
					},
					{ rest: true },
					{
						name: 'd1'
					},
					'', // quick clear
					{
						base: 4,
						name: 'd1'
					}
				],
			]
		}
	]
}

- BAH, SCREW VOICES, NOT YET
- voices need to share time-signatures, so each measure should have separate voice slots for notes
{
	staffs: [
		{
			clef: 'treble',
			voices: ['snare', 'bass'],
			measures: [
				[4,4], // time signature
				{
					// can we know beforehand whether snare should be top voice?
					// with bass below? does it matter?
					snare: [
						{
							base: 16, // 16th note
							name: 'c1', // might be an array, right?
							rest: false,
							tie: true // ties to first "tie:false" note
						},
						{ // note inherits values before it for ease?
							name: 'd1'
							tie: false
						},
						{ rest: true },
						{
							name: 'd1'
						},
						'', // quick clear
						{
							base: 4,
							name: 'd1'
						}
					],
					bass: [
					]
				}
			]
		}
	]
}
